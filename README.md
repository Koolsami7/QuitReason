# QuitReason
QuitReason started off as a plugin that I decided to make for my server, DoobieCraft.host. At first, it was just meant to show the reason that a player has disconnected. I wanted to know if players were timing out, or it was them disconnecting. 

Features
====
* Show reason user disconnected in quit message
* Show location user is connecting from in join message
* Location type configuration
* Works with 1.8-1.12.2 of Spigot/CraftBukkit
