# QuitReason
QuitReason started off as a plugin that I decided to make for my server, DoobieCraft.host. At first, it was just meant to show the reason that a player has disconnected. I wanted to know if players were timing out, or it was them disconnecting. Later on I decided to add custom join messages. You have the ability to grab the users network location in the join message. The type of location you would like to grab can be configured.

Features
====
* Show reason user disconnected in quit message
* Show location user is connecting from in join message
